(2015) contains details on these three methods and how the 503 diseases and 73 cell types were selected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Descriptions\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- **details_cells.tsv**: Details of the 73 cell types tested. File contains the cell type name (NAME, obtained from FANTOM5), the mapped Cell Ontology ID (CL.ID) and the mapped MeSH terms (MESH). \r\n- **details_diseases.tsv**: Details of the 503 diseases tested. File contains the disease name (NAME, obtained from DisGeNET), the mapped UMLS IDs (UMLS) and the mapped MeSH terms (MESH). \r\n- **gsc_pvalues.tsv**: P-values computed using the GSC method. \r\n- **gso_pvalues.tsv**: P-values computed using the GSO method. \r\n- **text_pvalues.tsv**: P-values computed through text-mining of PubMed using mapped MeSH terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[Cornish A.J., Filippis I., David A. and Sternberg M.J.E.
